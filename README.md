# controller-lib
This Android-library should help you to show a common game controller on the screen and react to its user input

At the moment the only supported Buttons are the Directionbuttons (8-way) and the Action-Input of a user, such as on the Playstation- or the XBox-Controller

This library uses VectorDrawable and has downwards support down to API Level 7 (using MrVector)

## Dependencies:
* [MrVector](https://github.com/telly/MrVector) in Version 0.2.0
* appcompat
